Create a slide with a light green background featuring a subtle hexagonal pattern.

1. **Title Section**: 
   - Insert a large white textbox in the middle.
   - Type the title "ENVIRONMENT" in bold green font at the top of the textbox.

2. **Content Section**: 
   - Below the title, add the following text in bullet points using a black font:
     - "Everything around us is known as environment."
     - "It includes every living and non living thing."
     - "Everything which we see in our surroundings such as sunlight, atmosphere, land, water, minerals, humans, plants, animals, insects, air etc. comes in environment."
     - "It is the sum of all surroundings which we see."
   - Ensure the text is aligned to the left within the textbox.

3. **Image Section**: 
   - Place an image of a tree being held in hands on the top-right side of the slide, ensuring it complements the content.

4. **Formatting**: 
   - Adjust the font sizes for clarity, making the title larger than the bullet points.
   - Maintain consistent spacing between the bullet points for a clean look.
