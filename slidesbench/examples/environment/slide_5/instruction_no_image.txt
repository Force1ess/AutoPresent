Create a slide with a light green background featuring a subtle hexagonal pattern. Insert a large white textbox in the middle.

1. **Title Section**: 
   - Type the title "Further types of natural environment" in bold green font.

2. **Content Section**: 
   - Below the title, add the following text in bullet point format using a black font:
     - "Lithosphere- It is defined as the rock and crust surface that covers the earth. An example of lithosphere is the rocky mountain range."
     - "Hydrosphere- all the water on the earth's surface such as lakes and seas is known as hydrosphere."
     - "Atmosphere- the mixture of gases that surrounds the earth is known as atmosphere."
     - "Biosphere- the part of earth's surface and atmosphere which supports life and where plants and animals live is known as biosphere."
   - Ensure the text is aligned to the left within the textbox.

3. **Formatting**: 
   - Adjust the font sizes for clarity, making the title larger than the body text.
   - Maintain consistent spacing between the bullet points for a clean look.
