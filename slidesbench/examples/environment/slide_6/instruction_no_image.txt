Create a slide with a light green background featuring a subtle hexagonal pattern. Insert a large white textbox in the middle.

1. **Title Section**: 
   - Type the title "Human impact or influence on environment." in bold green font.

2. **Content Section**: 
   - Below the title, add the following text in a black font:
     - "we are living in this environment so we have definitely gave an impact on environment. So lets see some positive and negative impact of humans on environment."
   - Ensure the text is aligned to the left within the textbox.

3. **Image Section**: 
   - Insert an image of a sunset landscape below the texts, ensuring it complements the text.

4. **Formatting**: 
   - Adjust the font sizes for clarity, making the title larger than the body text.
   - Maintain consistent spacing between the title and the body text for a clean look.
