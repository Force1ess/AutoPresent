Create a slide with a light green background featuring a subtle hexagonal pattern. Insert a large white textbox in the middle.

1. **Title Section**: 
   - Type the title "Types of environments" in bold green font at the top of the white textbox.

2. **Content Section**: 
   - Below the title, add the following text in bullet points using a black font:
     - "Natural environment"
     - "Human environment"
     - "Physical environment"
   - Ensure the text is aligned to the left within the textbox.

3. **Image Section**: 
   - Place an image of a countryside scene on the right side of the slide, ensuring it complements the content.

4. **Formatting**: 
   - Adjust the font sizes for clarity, making the title larger than the bullet points.
   - Maintain consistent spacing between the bullet points for a clean look.
