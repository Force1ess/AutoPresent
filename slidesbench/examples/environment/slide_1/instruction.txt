Create a slide with a light green background featuring a subtle hexagonal pattern.

1. **Title Section**: 
   - Insert a large white textbox on the right side.
   - Type the title "NATURAL ENVIRONMENT" in bold green font at the top of the textbox.

2. **Content Section**: 
   - Below the title, add the following details in black font:
     - "Name- Abhra Pawan Sharma"
     - "Class- 9H"
     - "Roll no- 4"
   - Ensure the text is aligned to the left within the textbox.

3. **Formatting**: 
   - Adjust the font sizes for clarity, making the title larger than the other text.
   - Maintain consistent spacing between the lines for a clean look.
