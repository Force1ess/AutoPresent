3. **Text Labels**: Below each logo, add the text "Belo" under the left logo and "Community" under the right logo. Use a clean, sans-serif font in white for visibility.

4. **Alignment**: Center all elements on the slide for a balanced look.

5. **Visual Balance**: Ensure the logos and text are proportionate and do not crowd the edges of the slide.

6. **Final Review**: Check for alignment, readability, and overall aesthetics before finalizing the slide.
