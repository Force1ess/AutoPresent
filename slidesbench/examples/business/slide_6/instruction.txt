Create a slide with the following elements:

1. **Background Color**: Set the background color to a solid coral.
2. **Title**: Add the text "This is BÃ©lo." in a large, bold font, centered on the slide.
3. **Font Color**: Use white for the text to ensure good contrast against the coral background.

Ensure the text is well-centered and visually balanced on the slide.
