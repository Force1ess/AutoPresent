Create a slide with the following elements:

1. **Background Color**: Use a solid coral color for the entire slide.
2. **Logo**: Place the Airbnb icon on the entire left side of the slide. Place the text "airbnb" logo on the right side of the slide, centered vertically.
3. **Title**: Add the text "Business Case" in a prominent font, centered vertically and below the text logo.
4. **Names**: Below the title, list the names:
   - Daniel Consuegra
   - Alejandra Del Chiaro
   - Maria Camila Echeverri
   Use a smaller font size for the names, ensuring they are also aligned to the right.
5. **Font Color**: Use white for all text elements to ensure good contrast against the coral background. 

Ensure all elements are well-spaced and visually balanced.
