Create a slide titled "Elon's Future Plans" with a yellow horizontal line below the title. 

On the left side, include the following bullet points:
- By 2027, Musk wants to launch 12,000 broadband satellites into orbit.
- HYPERLOOP trains start running in 2025.
- Propagation of Open-source technology.
- Mars colonization by 2030.

On the right side, insert an image of Elon Musk. Ensure the image is clear and well-aligned.

Use a white background for the slide, and add a yellow accent on the right side for visual appeal.
