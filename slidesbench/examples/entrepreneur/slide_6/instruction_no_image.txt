Add the following content below the title:
- "When he was in college, he considered what he wanted to accomplish with his life and came up with a list of five ideas."
  
List the five ideas as bullet points:
- The internet
- Sustainable energy
- Space exploration
- Life beyond earth
- Artificial intelligence
- Reprogramming the human genetic code

Place an image of a person pondering the next big idea on the right side of the slide. Use a white background for the main content area and a yellow accent on the right side. Ensure the text is clear and legible.
