Create a slide titled "Elon Musk Current Stage" with the following bullet points:

- CEO and Chief Engineer at SpaceX
- CEO and Product Architect of Tesla
- Founder of The Boring Company
- Cofounder of Neuralink
- Cofounder of OpenAI

Position the text on the left side of the slide. Use a clean, sans-serif font for clarity. 

On the right side, insert an image of Elon Musk with logos of his companies. Ensure the image is visually appealing and complements the text.

Use a yellow accent for the title and a white background for the slide. The left side should have a thin vertical yellow line for separation.
