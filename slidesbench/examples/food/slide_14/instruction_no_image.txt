Create a slide titled "PART 4" with the instruction: "List the events in Joey’s second date with Sarah in order from 2 - 6. The first one has been done as an example."

Below the title, list the events in numbered format from 1 to 6, ensuring the first event is already filled in as an example. Use the following content:

1. Joey apologizes for getting angry that Sarah took his food on the first date.
2. The waiter arrives with their desserts.
3. Joey doesn’t like the dessert he orders and tries to order a different one.
4. Sarah leaves the table for a phone call.
5. Joey is unable to control himself and eats all of Sarah’s dessert.
6. Joey refuses to apologize when Sarah returns.

Include an image of Joey from the show on the bottom-right corner of the slide. Add a button to its right that says "VIEWING ACTIVITY" in white text and dark blue background.
Ensure the background is visually appealing and complements the text.
