Create a slide titled "What do you think is the general rule for this pronunciation scheme?" with the subtitle "PART 3" in the top left corner.

Include three options labeled a, b, and c, formatted as follows:

- a) We add stress/intonation on the time or location weâ€™re speaking about.
- b) We add stress/intonation on the present participle (-ing verb).
- c) We add stress/intonation on the last word of the clause when retelling events. (indicate this option as correct with a checkmark)

Use a light background color and ensure the text is clear and legible. Add a sidebar or footer labeled "PRONUNCIATION ACTIVITY" for context.
