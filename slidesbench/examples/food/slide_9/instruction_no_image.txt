Create a slide with the following structure:

For the top half of the slide:
1. Title: "PART 1" in a bold, blue box at the top left.
2. Instruction Text: "Discuss/Write short answers below according to the information." in a clear font.
3. Questions: put the exam logo on the left, then put questions one the right side.
   - 1: "What happened on Joey’s first date with Sarah?" with a blank space for answers.
   - 2: "How does Joey feel about their first date? What does he say about it?" with a blank space for answers.
4. **Time Indicators**: Include "0:18" next to Question 1 and "0:48" next to Question 2.

For the bottom half of the slide:
5. **Title for Part 2**: "PART 2" in a bold, blue box below Part 1.
6. **Instruction for Part 2**: "Refer back to Preview, Part 3. How similar was your date story to Joey’s?" in a clear font.
7. **Visual Elements**: Include relevant icons (like a notepad for Part 1 and a play button for Part 2) and a small image of Joey from the show on the right side of Part 1.
8. **Button**: Add a "VIEWING ACTIVITY" button at the bottom, styled to stand out.

Use a light background color to ensure readability.
