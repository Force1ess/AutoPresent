Create a slide titled "PART 4" in the top left corner, using a bold font and a blue background. Below, add the instruction: "Tell the short story below out loud using the pronunciation rule you studied on the previous slide." Put the icon of human speaking below the title.

Include the text: 
"Last week, I went on a date. We were skating in the park, we were laughing, and the guy was making some really funny jokes...and then, out of nowhere, I fell down and I broke my leg!"

Include a relevant image of people skating on the right side of the slide.

Add a section at the bottom with the instruction: "Play and listen to the audio clip to check your answers. Repeat if necessary." 

Incorporate an audio icon next to this instruction. Use a light gray background for the slide and ensure the text is clear and legible.
