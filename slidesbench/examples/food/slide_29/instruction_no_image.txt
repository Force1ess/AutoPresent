Create a slide titled "PART 1" at the top left corner. Below it, add a chat icon. Right to it, add the instruction: "Answer the questions below about the video." 

List the following questions in a numbered format:
1. What happened on Joey’s first date with Sarah?
2. How did Joey’s friends, Phoebe and Rachel, react or respond to his date story?
3. How did Joey feel about his first date with Sarah?
4. What happened on Joey’s second date with Sarah?

Use a light background color and format the questions with a border around each. Include a button labeled "QUIZ & REVIEW ACTIVITY" at the bottom right corner.
