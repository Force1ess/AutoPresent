Create a slide titled "Pronunciation Activity" with two sections labeled "PART 1" and "PART 2." Put an exam logo below the title.

**For PART 1:**
- Include the instruction: "Play the audio clips below. On which words do you notice the stress/intonation?"
- List four audio clips with corresponding sentences:
  1. “We were out to dinner, ok… We were getting along…”
  2. “We were having a really nice time.”
  3. “I was thinking she was really cool.”
  4. “And then, out of nowhere…”
- Add text boxes for "stressed word(s):" after each sentence.
- Put the media play icon on the left side of each audio clip.

**For PART 2:**
- Include the instruction: "Repeat each sentence above out loud. Put stress/intonation on the words you marked in Part 1."

Use a clean, professional layout with clear fonts. Ensure there is enough space for responses in the text boxes.
