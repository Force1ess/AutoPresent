Create a slide titled "PART 3" with the instruction: "Choose true (T), false (F), or not given (N) according to the information in the video." 

Include a table with three rows for statements, labeled 1, 2, and 3. Each row should have checkboxes for T, F, and N. 

Add the following statements:
1. Phoebe sarcastically says that Sarah is a monster for her etiquette.
2. Joey prefers eating French fries with his fingers.
3. Rachel is surprised to hear about Joeyâ€™s food sharing rule.

Place an image of Joey on the right side of the slide. At the bottom, include a button labeled "VIEWING ACTIVITY." 

Use a clean layout with a light background for readability.
