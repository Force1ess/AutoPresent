Create a slide titled "PART 4" with the instruction: "List the events in Joey’s second date with Sarah in order from 2 - 6. The first one has been done as an example."

Below the title, include a checklist format for the following events:

1. Sarah leaves the table for a phone call.
2. Joey doesn’t like the dessert he orders and tries to order a different one.
3. Joey refuses to apologize when Sarah returns.
4. Joey apologizes for getting angry that Sarah took his food on the first date.
5. Joey is unable to control himself and eats all of Sarah’s dessert.
6. The waiter arrives with their desserts.

Add a small image of Joey on the bottom-right corner of the slide, and put two buttons on its right: "Check your answers" in pink text and transparent background, and "VIEWING ACTIVITY" in white text and dark blue background.
Use a clean, readable font and ensure there is enough spacing between the items for clarity. Use a simple background that complements the text.
