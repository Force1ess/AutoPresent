Create a slide titled "PART 3" with instructions: "Choose true (T), false (F), or not given (N) according to the information in the video." Add the green check logo after the text.

Include a table with three rows for statements:
1. Phoebe sarcastically says that Sarah is a monster for her etiquette.
2. Joey prefers eating French fries with his fingers.
3. Rachel is surprised to hear about Joeyâ€™s food sharing rule.

Add checkboxes next to each statement for T, F, and N options. 

On the bottom right, place the image of Joey, and place two bottons below it: 
- "Check your answers": in pink text and border with transparent background; and
- "Viewing Activity": in white text and dark blue background.

Use a light background for the entire slide and ensure the text is clear and legible.
