Create a slide with the following elements:

1. **Title**: "STEP 2:" at the top left, in a bold font.
2. **Bullet Points**: 
   - "Imagine you actually went on the date you chose on the previous slide and something went wrong."
   - "Describe what happened on the date using the past simple and past continuous."
   - "Take a few minutes to prepare your story about the date below. Write 3 - 5 sentences."
3. **Text Box**: Below the bullet points, include a labeled box titled "YOUR ‘DATE GONE WRONG’ STORY" for writing. Put the exam icon left to it.
4. **Additional Section**: Below the text box, add "STEP 3:" in a bold font, followed by the instruction: "Retell the story to your class or teacher. Use stress/intonation in the appropriate places when retelling the story."
5. **Design**: Use a light background color and ensure the text is clear and legible. Include decorative elements or graphics related to storytelling or dates on the side.

Make sure to maintain a consistent font style and size throughout the slide.
