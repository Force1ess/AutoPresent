Create a slide with a dark blue background. 

1. Add the title "PREVIEW ACTIVITY" in large, bold, white font, centered on the slide.
2. Insert a light bulb graphic with a brain inside it to the left of the title.
3. Include a thin horizontal line below the title, extending across the slide.
4. Place the "FLUENT" logo in the top right corner.

Ensure all elements are well-aligned and visually balanced.
