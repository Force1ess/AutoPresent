Create a slide titled "QUIZ & REVIEW ACTIVITY" in large, bold white text. Below it, add the instruction "Work with a partner." in smaller white text. 

Set the background color to dark blue. Include a relevant icon (like a checklist or magnifying glass) on the left side of the title. 

Incorporate the "FLUENT" logo in the top right corner. Ensure all text is centered and visually balanced.
