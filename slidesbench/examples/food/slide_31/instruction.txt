Create a slide titled "LESSON REFLECTION:" at the top left, using a bold, dark blue font. 

Add three numbered questions in a clear, readable font:
1. Did you learn or use any new vocabulary, grammar, phrases, etc. in this lesson? If so, what?
2. What did you enjoy about the lesson?
3. Is there anything you found difficult about the lesson?

Use a light background color for the slide. Include a speech bubble graphic next to the title; and a image of blackboard at the bottom right labeled "QUIZ & REVIEW ACTIVITY." Ensure the questions are spaced evenly and easy to read.
