Create a slide titled "VIEWING FOLLOW-UP" in large, bold white text centered on the slide. 

On the left side, include a light bulb icon with a brain inside it. 

Use a dark blue background for the entire slide. 

In the top right corner, add the "FLUENT" logo. 

Ensure all elements are well-aligned and visually balanced.
