Create a slide titled "PART 2" at the top left corner. Below it, add the exam logo. On its right, add the instruction: "Read the sentences and categorize each example of the past simple/past continuous."

Include the dialogue text in a text box, ensuring it is clearly readable. 
- "JOEY: We were out to dinner. We were getting along, having a really nice time, I was thinking she was really cool and then, out of nowhere, (she reached over and took some of my fries from my plate!)"
- "PHOEBE: So she took some fries, big deal!"
- "RACHEL: Oh yeah, Joey doesn't share food. I mean, just last week, we were having breakfast, and...and he had a couple of grapes on his plate..."

Below the dialogue, create a table with two columns labeled "PAST SIMPLE" and "PAST CONTINUOUS." 

In the "PAST SIMPLE" column, include the sentence: "We were out to dinner." 

Leave the "PAST CONTINUOUS" column empty for categorization.

Use a clean, professional layout with a light background and contrasting text colors for clarity.
