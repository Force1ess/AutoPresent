Create a slide titled "PART 1" in a blue textbox, followed by the instruction "Discuss the questions below." in a smaller font. Put the conversation icon below the title.

List the following questions:
1. What do you think about Sarah’s etiquette on the first date? What about Joey’s etiquette on the second date? Whose etiquette was worse and why?
2. What parts of the video do you think were the funniest and why?

Use a light background color for the slide. Add a circular image of Joey from Friends on the right side. Include a play button icon at the bottom left labeled "VIEWING FOLLOW-UP."
