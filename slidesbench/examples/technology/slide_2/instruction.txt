Create a slide titled "What is Blockchain?" in a large, bold font at the top.

Add the following content as bullet points:

- Blockchain is a type of decentralized, distributed database or ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers.
- In blockchain, a list of records is stored as blocks and they are linked by using cryptography.
- Hence, we can say that blockchain is a digital record and is used for recording transactions made with cryptocurrencies such as bitcoins.
- If we add a new block, it can be linked with the previous block with the help of a cryptographic block generated from the previous block. By doing this, the block is permanently recorded and it is not broken.
- In blockchain, previous transactions' alteration is very difficult because all subsequent blocks also need to be altered. We can say that blockchain is the purest peer-to-peer database that is immutable.

Ensure the text is clear and easy to read, using a simple font. Maintain consistent spacing between bullet points. Use a clean background to enhance readability.
