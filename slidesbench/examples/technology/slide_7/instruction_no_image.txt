Create a slide titled "Blockchain in Cryptocurrency" at the top center.

Add the following bullet points in the main content area:
- The term blockchain is often used to refer to cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange such as US dollars.
- It is just an application in the form of e-currency using blockchain.
- It is not governed by any financial institution.
- The main difference between blockchain and cryptocurrency is that cryptocurrency is created and held electronically in forms such as a virtual wallet.
- It is decentralized and it is not governed by anyone whereas blockchain is an advanced record and it has all information related to cryptocurrency exchanges over a shared system.

Place an image of a Bitcoin on the right side of the slide.

Ensure the text is clear and legible, using a contrasting color against the background.
