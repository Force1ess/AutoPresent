Create a slide titled "Blockchain in Bitcoin" at the top.

Add the following text below the title:
- "CRYPTOCURRENCY bitcoin is one of the crypto currency"
- "Bitcoin is one of the most popular and successful implementations of blockchain technology. It is an open source cryptocurrency that uses distributed peer-to-peer computing. There is no need of a central authority to manage bitcoin network."

Place an image of a Bitcoin on the right side of the slide.

Ensure the text is left-aligned and the image is appropriately sized to fit without overlapping the text. Use a clean, professional font and maintain a balanced layout.
