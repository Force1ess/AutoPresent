Create a slide titled "Types of Blockchain" at the top. 

Add the following content as bullet points:

- **Private Blockchain Networks:** Private blockchains operate on closed networks, and tend to work well for private businesses and organizations.
  
- **Public Blockchain Networks:** Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies originated from public blockchains, which also played a role in popularizing distributed ledger technology (DLT).
  
- **Permissioned Blockchain Networks:** Also sometimes known as hybrid blockchains, permissioned blockchain networks are private blockchains that allow special access for authorized individuals.
  
- **Hybrid Blockchains:** Hybrid blockchains are the combination of both public and private blockchains. In a hybrid blockchain, some parts of the blockchain are public and transparent, while others are private and accessible only to authorized and specific participants.

Ensure the text is clear and legible, using a simple font. Use appropriate spacing between bullet points for readability.
