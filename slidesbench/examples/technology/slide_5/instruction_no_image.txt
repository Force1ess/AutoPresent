Create a slide titled "The Technology used in Blockchain" in a large, bold font at the top. 

Add a bulleted list on the left with the following items:
- Cryptographic Keys
- Network Protocol
- Distributed Ledger Technology
- Hashing

Align the list to the left side of the slide. 

On the right side, insert an image related to blockchain technology. Ensure the image is appropriately sized to fit without overlapping the text. 

Use a clean, professional background color to enhance readability.
