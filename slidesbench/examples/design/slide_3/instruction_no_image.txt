Create a slide titled "Components of visual communication." 

In the main content area, include the following bullet points:
- "Components of craftsmanship are the essential units of any visual plan that structure the plan's design and pass on its visual messages."
- "The components of visual computerization are line, shape, size, color, Typography, Space and Texture."

Use a visually engaging background image related to art or design. Ensure the text is clear and legible against the background, adjusting font size and color as necessary for readability.
