Create a slide titled "Principles of graphic design" on the left side with large, white text on a blue background.

On the right side, add a text box with the title "The principles of graphic design related to the areas are," in a smaller font with a light blue background.

Below this title, list the following items in separate text boxes with varying shades of blue and green backgrounds:
- Arrangement
- Proximity
- Repetition
- Contrast
- Balance

Ensure the text is clear and legible, with consistent font size and style throughout.
