Create a slide with the title "Globalization isnâ€™t possible to occur without media." 

Add the following content in bullet points:
1. "Electronic media allowed opportunities to spread all over the world."
2. "Radio and Television is a powerful mass medium in providing accessible information for people."
3. "Digital media through phone and computers allows people to access information from around the world."

Format the title in a large, bold font. Use a smaller, readable font for the bullet points. 

Include an image of two people talking right to the bullet points to enhance visual appeal. Ensure the background is simple to maintain focus on the text.
