Create a slide titled "Three perspectives on global cultural flows:" with a dark blue background. 

1. Add the subtitle "3. CULTURAL CONVERGENCE" in a larger font, centered below the main title.
2. Include two bullet points:
   - "approach stresses homogeneity introduced by globalization."
   - "Cultures are deemed to be radically altered by strong flows, while cultural imperialism happens when one culture imposes itself on and tends to destroy at least parts of another culture."
3. Use a clear, readable font in white for the text.
4. Ensure proper spacing between the title, subtitle, and bullet points for clarity.
