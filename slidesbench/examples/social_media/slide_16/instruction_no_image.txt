Create a slide titled "Global and Local Cultural Products" with a subtitle "Cultural Products" below it. 

Add the following bullet point: "✓ are goods and services such as arts, architectures, museums etc. that showcase the history and information of certain which belong to the country’s cultural heritage."

Insert three images aligned horizontally at the bottom of the slide, showing (1) a close-up of a beautifully woven ethnic fabric, (2) a beautifully crafted Japanese Kokeshi doll in bright red kimono, and (3) sunset over La Sagrada Família, an architectural masterpiece still under construction in Barcelona, Spain. Ensure the images are relevant to cultural products.

Use a blue background for the title textbox, with white text. The main content should have a white background with black text.
