Create a slide titled "5 Stages of Development of Media" at the top. Use a solid dark blue background with white text.

For the rest of the page, use a clean, professional layout with a white background and dark blue text for contrast.

Below the title, add a subheading "5. DIGITAL MEDIA" in a larger font.

In the main content area, include the following bullet points:
- "Digitized content that can be transmitted over the internet or computer networks."
- "It allows the advertisement of products and online business transactions."

Place an appropriate image of digital media (like a laptop with icons) on the right side of the slide.
