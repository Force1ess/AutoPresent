Create a slide titled "Three perspectives on global cultural flows:" with a dark blue background.

Add a section for the first perspective:
- Title: "1. CULTURAL DIFFERENTIALISM" in bold, white text.
- Use bullet points for the following content:
  - "emphasizes the fact that cultures are essentially different and are only superficially affected by global flows."
  - "It also involves barriers that prevent flows that serve to make cultures more a line; cultures tend to remain stubbornly different from one another."

Ensure the text is in a clear, readable font, with appropriate spacing between lines and bullet points.
