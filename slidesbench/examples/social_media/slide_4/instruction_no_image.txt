Create a slide titled "5 Stages of Development of Media" at the top in a large white font, with dark blue background. 

Below, add the subtitle "1. ORAL COMMUNICATION" in a slightly smaller font in dark blue text.

Include two bullet points:
- "Language allowed humans to communicate and share information."
- "Language became the most important tool for exploring the world and different cultures."

On the right side of the slide, insert an image related to communication, showing diverse voices sharing ideas and cultures. Ensure the background is clean and visually appealing, using a light color to enhance readability.
