Create a slide titled "5 Stages of Development of Media" in a large font at the top. Below, add the subtitle "4. ELECTRONIC MEDIA" in a slightly smaller font.

Include the following bullet points:
- "It includes the telegraphs, telephone, radio, film and television."
- "The wide range of these media continue to open up new perspectives on economic, political and cultural processes of globalization."

On the right side of the slide, insert an image of electronic media (radio, television, etc.) that complements the text. Use a clean, professional layout with a white background and dark blue background for only the title.
