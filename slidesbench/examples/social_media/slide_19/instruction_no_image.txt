Create a slide titled "Three perspectives on global cultural flows:" with a dark blue background.

Add a subheading "2. CULTURAL HYBRIDIZATION" in a larger font, colored white.

Include the following bullet points:
- a process by which a cultural element blends into another culture by modifying the element to fit cultural norms.
- It is actually an integration of local and global cultures.
- A key concept is “glocalization” or the interpenetration of the global and local resulting in unique outcomes in different geographic areas.

Format the bullet points with a checkmark symbol (✓) before each point. Use a clear, readable font in black for the text.
