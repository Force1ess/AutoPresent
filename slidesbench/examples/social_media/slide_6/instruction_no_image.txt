Create a slide titled "5 Stages of Development of Media" in a large, bold font at the top. Use white text on a dark blue background.

For the rest of the page, set the background color to white, the title text color to dark blue and main text to black for contrast.

Add a subtitle "3. PRINTING PRESS" below it, also in bold. 

Include the main content: 
- "It allowed the continuous production, reproduction and circulation of print materials." 

Use bullet points for the main content. 

Place an illustration of a printing press on the right side of the slide.
