Create a slide titled "Two kinds of Art as to Subject" with the following content:

**1. Representational or Objective Art**
   - The subject is directly represented in the artwork like the subjects seen in portraits and other realistic visual art presentations.

Add a smaller title on the top-left corner: "The Subject and Content of Art". 

Use a yellow background for the title textboxes and black text. For the main content, use a white background. 

Use an colorful abstract image describing a vivid dance of colors and emotions as the slide background.
