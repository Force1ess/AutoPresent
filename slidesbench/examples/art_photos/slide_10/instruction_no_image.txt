Create a slide titled "Portrait" centered below the small title "The Subject and Content of Art" on the top-left corner of the slide. 

1. **Images**: Place two images side by side:
   - On the left, insert the image of the Mona Lisa.
   - On the right, insert the image of the child portrait.

2. **Formatting**: 
   - Ensure both images are of equal size and aligned properly.
   - Use a white background for the images.

3. **Text Box**: Use a yellow background for both titles with black text.

4. **Background**: Use an colorful abstract image describing a vivid dance of colors and emotions as the slide background.
