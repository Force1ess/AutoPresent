Create a slide titled "Three levels of meaning" with numbered points for the content. 

"1. Factual meaning - the literal statement or narrative content in the work that can be directly apprehended because the objects presented are easily recognized."
"2. Conventional meaning - refers to the special meaning that the certain object or color has for a particular culture or group of people when it is shown in an artwork."

Add a smaller title on the top-left corner "The Subject and Content of Art". 

Color the background of both title textboxes with yellow and the text color with black. For the main content, use a white background. 

Use an colorful abstract image describing a vivid dance of colors and emotions as the background of the slide.
