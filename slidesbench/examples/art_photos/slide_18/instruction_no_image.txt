Create a slide titled "THE CONTENT OF ART" with the following content:

- "It is the mass of ideas associated with each artwork and communicated through the following:"
- "1. The art’s imagery"
- "2. The symbolic meaning"
- "3. Its surroundings where it is used or displayed"
- "4. The customs, beliefs and values of the culture that uses it"

Use checkmarks (✓) before each bullet point. 

Add a smaller title on the top-left corner: "The Subject and Content of Art". 

Color the background of both title textboxes with yellow and the text color with black. For the main content, use a white background. 

Use an colorful abstract image describing a vivid dance of colors and emotions as the background of the slide.
