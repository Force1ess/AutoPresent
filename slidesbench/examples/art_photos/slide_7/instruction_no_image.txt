1. **Main Points:**
   - Use a bullet point for "Examples:"
   - Include a sub-bullet: "A. *Still life* is a work of art that does not have life."
   - Add another sub-bullet: "examples: (food, flower, plants, rocks or shells) or man-made (drinking glasses, books, vases, jewelry, coins and so on) in an artificial setting."

2. **Formatting:**
   - Highlight the word "Still life" in italics.
   - Use a clean, readable font.
   - Ensure the background is white for the main content area.

3. **Title and Subtitle:**
   - Add a smaller title on the top-left corner: "The Subject and Content of Art."
   - Color the background of both title textboxes with yellow and the text color with black.

Ensure all elements are well-aligned and visually appealing.
