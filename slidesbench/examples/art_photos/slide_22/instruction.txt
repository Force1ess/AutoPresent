Create a slide titled "KEEPING ART" in a large font. Below it, add a numbered list starting with "1. National Pride and Glory" in bold. 

Include a checkmark (âœ“) before the text: "nations keep art because it is good for the economy and for the business."

Add a smaller title on the top-left corner: "The Subject and Content of Art." 

Use a yellow background for the title textboxes and black text. For the main content, use a white background. 

Utilize the provided image as the background of the slide.
