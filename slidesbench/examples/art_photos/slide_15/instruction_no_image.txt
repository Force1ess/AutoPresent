Create a slide titled "Non-representational or Non-objective Art" in a large font. 

At the top-left corner, add a smaller title "The Subject and Content of Art." 

Below the title, on the left side, place an image showing an abstract expression of vibrant splashes. On the right side, first put an image showing a symphony of colors in motion on the top, then place an image of a vibrant abstract symphony on the bottom.
Ensuring all images are evenly spaced and aligned. 

Use a white border around the images for separation. 

Set the background of using an colorful abstract image describing a vivid dance of colors and emotions.

Ensure all text is clear and legible against the background.
