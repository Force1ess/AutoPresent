Create a slide titled "The Subject of Art" with two bullet points in the main content: 

1. "The subject is the visual focus or the image that may be extracted from examining the artworks."
2. "an artwork can be identified by its subject."

Add a smaller title in the top-left corner: "The Subject and Content of Art." 

Set the background color of both title textboxes to yellow and the text color to black. For the main content, use a white background with black text. 

Use the provided image as the background of the slide.
