Create a slide titled "Landscapes, seascapes, moonscapes, and cityscape" centered at the top.

Add a smaller title on the top-left corner: "The Subject and Content of Art".

Place two images side by side below the title (left: city view, right: countryside), ensuring they are evenly spaced. 

Use an colorful abstract image describing a vivid dance of colors and emotions as the slide background, and a white layer around the texts and images.

Ensure the text color is black for visibility against the background.
