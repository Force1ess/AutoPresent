Create a slide titled "D. Mythology and religion, dreams and fantasies." in large, bold text. 

At the top-left corner, add a smaller title "The Subject and Content of Art" in a contrasting color.

Insert two images side by side, ensuring they are evenly spaced and aligned. 
On the left, place an image showing an iconic portrayal of beauty and mythology, captured by Sandro Botticelli.
On the right, place an image showing a dramatic baroque portrayal of heroism and protection in tumultuous times.

Use an colorful abstract image describing a vivid dance of colors and emotions as the slide background. Ensuring the text is clearly visible against it by putting a white layer behind the texts and images.
