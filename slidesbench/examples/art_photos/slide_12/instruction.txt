Create a slide titled "D. Mythology and religion, dreams and fantasies." in large, bold text. 

At the top-left corner, add a smaller title "The Subject and Content of Art" in a contrasting color.

Insert two images side by side, ensuring they are evenly spaced and aligned. 

Use the provided image as the background of the slide, ensuring the text is clearly visible against it by putting a white layer behind the texts and images.
