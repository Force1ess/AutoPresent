Create a slide titled "Representational or Objective Art". Add a subheading "B. Portrait" in bold, underlined. 

Add two bullet points:
1. "is a realistic presentation of a human face"
2. "The purpose may be to show the resemble, personality, or disposition of the individual"

Use checkmarks (âœ“) before each bullet point. 

Include a smaller title on the top-left corner: "The Subject and Content of Art". 

Color the background of the title and subheading textboxes with yellow and the text color with black. For the main content, use a white background. 

Use an colorful abstract image describing a vivid dance of colors and emotions as the slide background.
