Create a slide titled "Subject of Art" with the following content: "A cat catching a bird is the subject of both works above." 

Place two images side by side, representing the artworks mentioned. 
On the left, put an image showing ferocious cat capturing a bird, depicted in a strikingly abstract and colorful style.
On the right, put an image showing artistic expressions through still life and sculptures: A journey of feline mystique and organic allure.

Add a smaller title on the top-left corner: "The Subject and Content of Art." 

Color the background of the title textbox with yellow and the text color with black. For the main content, use a white background. 

Use an colorful abstract image describing a vivid dance of colors and emotions as the slide background.
