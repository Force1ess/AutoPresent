Create a slide titled "Two kinds of Art as to Subject" with the following content:

1. **Main Point**: "2. Non-representational or Non-objective Art"
   - Use a bullet point format for the following:
     - "Also known as non-objective art"
     - "The subject is not obviously or directly represented"
     - "Example: Total Abstractions- non-representational or non-objective because they stray away from the reality. Not all abstracts are non-representational."

2. **Formatting**:
   - Use a yellow background for the title textbox and black text.
   - Use a white background for the main content area with black text.
   - Ensure bullet points are marked with checkmarks (âœ“).

3. **Additional Title**: Add a smaller title on the top-left corner: "The Subject and Content of Art".

4. **Background**: Use the provided image as the background of the slide. Add a smaller white overlay to make the text more readable.
