Create a slide titled "The Subject of Art" with two bullet points in the main content: 

1. "The subject of art is usually anything that is represented in the artwork."
2. "It may be a person, object, scene or event."

Add a smaller title in the top-left corner: "The Subject and Content of Art." 

Set the background color of both title textboxes to yellow and the text color to black. For the main content area, use a white background. 

Use an colorful abstract image describing a vivid dance of colors and emotions as the slide background.
