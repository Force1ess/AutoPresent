Create a slide titled "Animals" centered below the top title "The Subject and Content of Art." 

1. **Images**: Place two images side by side:
   - On the left, insert an image of a rabbit.
   - On the right, insert an image depicting various animals with a person.

2. **Formatting**:
   - Ensure both images are of equal size and aligned properly.
   - Add a white border around each image for contrast.

3. **Background**: Use an colorful abstract image describing a vivid dance of colors and emotions as the slide background. Put a white overlay on the background to make the text more readable.

4. **Text Color**: Use black for the title text. 

5. **Spacing**: Maintain adequate spacing between the title and images for clarity.
