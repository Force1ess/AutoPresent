Create a slide with the title "ELO's" at the top, on the right side of the slide. Below the title, list two points: "1. What is market?" and "2. How product reach to market?" 

On the left side, use the provided image as the background, ensuring the text is clearly visible. Apply a semi-transparent dark overlay to enhance text readability. Position the text on the right side of the slide, ensuring it does not overlap with any important visual elements in the background.
