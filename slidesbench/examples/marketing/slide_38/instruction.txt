Create a slide titled "Opportunity Created by Market" in a large, bold font at the top. Use a gradient background transitioning from dark teal to light teal, only for the title region on the top.

Below the title, arrange six icons in a horizontal line, each with a corresponding label:
   - **Icon 1:** Factory (Demand of Raw Material)
   - **Icon 2:** Graph (Demand for Labour)
   - **Icon 3:** Shop (More Shops in Market)
   - **Icon 4:** Bus (Transportations)
   - **Icon 5:** Buildings (Infrastructure)
   - **Icon 6:** Person (Employment)
Ensure each icon is in a colored square with rounded corners.

Use a consistent font for the labels, ensuring they are clear and legible. Align all elements centrally for a balanced look.
