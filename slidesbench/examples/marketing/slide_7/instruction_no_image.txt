Create a slide with a background image of a market scene. 

1. **Add Circular Images**: Overlay two circular images on the background:
   - One larger circle on the left showing the shopping mall.
   - A smaller circle on the right showing food market, with a half-transparent overlay to blend with the background.

2. **Insert Text**: Place the text "Market is a place where products or services are bought or sold." on the right side of the slide. Use a clear, legible font in white or light color for contrast.

3. **Add Attribution**: Include the text "This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-SA." at the bottom of the slide in smaller font.

4. **Adjust Transparency**: Ensure the background image on the right is slightly dimmed to enhance text visibility.

5. **Final Touches**: Ensure all elements are well-aligned and visually balanced.
