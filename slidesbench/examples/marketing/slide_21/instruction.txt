Create a slide titled "Sales and Distribution" centered at the bottom with a gray background and black text.

Incorporate a flowchart above the title, featuring the following elements:

1. Three vertical sections labeled "Direct," "Retail," and "Wholesale."
2. Connect each section to "Producer or manufacturer" and "Wholesaler" as appropriate.
3. Include "Consumer" and "Retailer" at the end of the flowchart.

Use orange boxes for the flowchart elements and ensure clear lines connect them. 

Set the background of the slide to a dark gradient to enhance visibility. Include a small attribution note at the bottom right: "This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-SA-NC."
