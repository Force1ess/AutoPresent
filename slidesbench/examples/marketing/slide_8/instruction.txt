Create a slide titled "THINK LINE:" in a large, bold font at the top. Below it, add the question "Q. How products reach to us?" in a slightly smaller font. Put these texts on the right side of the slide.

Incorporate a light bulb graphic with a gear inside, positioned to the left of the text. Ensure the background is a gradient of teal to dark green.

Use a contrasting color for the text, such as light blue, to enhance readability. Adjust the layout to ensure the graphic and text are balanced and visually appealing.
