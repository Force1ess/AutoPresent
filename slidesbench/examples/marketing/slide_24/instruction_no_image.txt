Create a slide with the following elements:

1. **Background**: Use an image showing a busy shopping mall, placed in a curved shape, as the background of the left half of the slide. Use a solid black background for the rest of the slide.
2. **Title**: Add "ELO's" at the middle bottom in a large, bold font.
3. **Subtitle**: Below the title, add "1. Types of Market" in a slightly smaller font.
4. **Text Color**: Use white for the title and subtitle text.
5. **Shape**: Overlay a circular mask on the left side of the image to create a focal point for the text.
6. **Additional Element**: Include a small red rectangle in the top right corner for visual interest.
7. **Attribution**: Add a small text box at the bottom right with the attribution "This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-SA."

Ensure the text is legible against the background.
