Create a slide titled "Now: I, CAN" at the top. 

Add two bullet points below:
1. "Define the term Marketing"
2. "Explain various things involved how products reach to market"

Use a white background for the bullet points with a thin orange border. 

Incorporate downward arrows in orange and yellow to separate the bullet points. 

Set the background of the slide to a gradient of black and gray, with a textured image on the right side.
