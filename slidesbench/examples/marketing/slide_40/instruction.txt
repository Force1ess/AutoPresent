Create a slide featuring a collage of images. 

1. **Image Arrangement**: Use five images:
   - Top left: A person sculpting.
   - Top right: Someone painting.
   - Center: A group of people in a field.
   - Bottom left: A market with fruits and vegetables.
   - Bottom right: An interior view of a shopping mall.

2. **Shape**: Use circular frames for each image to create a cohesive look.

3. **Background**: Keep the background simple to ensure the images stand out.

4. **Spacing**: Ensure there is even spacing between the images for a balanced layout.

5. **Title**: Add a title at the top of the slide, such as "Art and Everyday Life," in a clear, bold font.

6. **Color Scheme**: Use a neutral color for the title text to maintain focus on the images.

7. **Final Touches**: Ensure all images are high quality and properly aligned.
