Create a slide titled "From Factory to the Market" at the top. 

1. Divide the slide into four sections (from left to right), each representing a step.
2. Use colored shapes for each step:
   - Step 1: Orange rectangle labeled "Producer" with the text "• Goods are produced in large factories or farms."
   - Step 2: Yellow rectangle labeled "Wholesale" with the text "• Wholesalers buy goods in large quantity from factories or farms."
   - Step 3: Yellow rectangle labeled "Distributors" with the text "• They provide goods to retailers on their demand."
   - Step 4: Yellow rectangle labeled "Retailer" with the text "• Sell goods to consumers."
3. Ensure the text is clear and legible, using a contrasting color against the background.
4. Use a subtle background design that complements the text and shapes.
