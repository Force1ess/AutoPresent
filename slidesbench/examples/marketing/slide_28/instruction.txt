Create a slide titled "Types of Market" in a doubled-arrow shape centered at the top. Use a bold, large font in white, over solid red background.

Add two red arrows pointing left and right from the title. Below the title, create four red boxes with the following text:
- "Weekly market"
- "Neighborhood market"
- "Shopping Complexes"
- "Malls"

All text blocks in red textboxes with white text.

Use downward arrows to connect the title to each row of boxes.

Set the background to a gradient of teal or blue for contrast.
