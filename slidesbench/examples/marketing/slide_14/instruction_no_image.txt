Create a slide with the following elements:

1. **Background**: Use an image featuring azure circles creating a hypnotic, abstract design.
2. **Text**: Add the question: "Q. How often you think about social impact of your action before you act?" 
   - **Font**: Use a large, clear font for visibility.
   - **Color**: Set the text color to white for contrast against the background.
   - **Alignment**: Center the text on the slide.
3. **Design Element**: Add a red rectangle in the top right corner for emphasis.

Ensure all elements are balanced and visually appealing.
