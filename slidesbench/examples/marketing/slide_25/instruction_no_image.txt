Create a slide with the following elements:

1. **Background**: Use an image showing a group of people holding candles in a solemn vigil, illuminating the darkness together., as the left half of the background, blending into a solid teal color on the right.

2. **Text**: Add the question:
   - "Q. Do you think 'vocal for local' is not just a slogan but it is the need of the time."
   - Position the text on the right side of the slide.

3. **Text Formatting**: 
   - Use a clear, legible font.
   - Ensure the text color contrasts well with the background (white or light color recommended).

4. **Additional Element**: Add a small red rectangle in the top right corner for visual interest.

5. **Alignment**: Center the text vertically and horizontally within the right section of the slide.
