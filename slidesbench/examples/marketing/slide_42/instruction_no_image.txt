Create a slide titled "Now: I, Can" with two bullet points: 

1. "Explain how market create opportunities."
2. "Identify and list the people who earn more profit in Market."

Use a clean, modern font for the text. Position the title at the top left and the bullet points below it. 

On the left side:
- include an image of two men in a field at the bottom, and 
- on the top, use a gradient background transitioning from dark green to light green. 

Add a red rectangle in the top right corner for emphasis. Ensure the overall layout is balanced and visually appealing.
