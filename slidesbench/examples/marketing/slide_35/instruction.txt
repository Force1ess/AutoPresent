Create a slide titled "Types of Retailers." 

1. Add two boxes for content:
   - Top box: "1. Mobile retailers" with a gold background.
   - Bottom box: "2. Fixed â€“ Shop Retailers" with an orange background.

2. Include a downward arrow between the two boxes.

3. Use a clean, modern font for all text, ensuring readability.

4. Position the title on the left side of the slide in white text. Set the background of the title region on the left to a gradient of dark teal to lighter teal.

5. Ensure all elements are aligned and spaced evenly for a professional look.
