Create a slide titled "ELO's" in a large, bold font on the left side. 

Add two bullet points below it:
- "Market and Opportunity"
- "Market and Equality"

Use a black background for the left side and a contrasting image on the right side. Ensure the text color is white for visibility. Adjust the layout so the text is clearly legible against the background.
