Create a slide titled "HOMEWORK" in bold, large font at the top. Below it, add the question: "Q1. Explain how a chain of market is formed? What purpose does it serve. (3+2=5 MARKS)" in a clear, readable font.

Use a background image that features abstract figures or silhouettes to convey a market theme. Ensure the text is in white or light color for contrast against the background. Adjust the text size for clarity and balance on the slide.
