Create a slide titled "Types of Fixed Retailers" at the top center. 

1. **Layout**: Divide the slide into three equal sections horizontally.
2. **Images**: 
   - Place an image of a general store on the left.
   - Place an image of a department store in the center.
   - Place an image of a chain store on the right.
3. **Text**: 
   - Above each image, add the corresponding label: "General Stores," "Department Store," and "Chain Store."
4. **Background**: Use a gradient teal background for the entire slide.
5. **Font**: Use a clear, bold font for the title and a slightly smaller font for the labels.

Ensure all elements are aligned and visually balanced.
