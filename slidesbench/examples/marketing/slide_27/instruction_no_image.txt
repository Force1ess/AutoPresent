Create a slide titled "Types of Markets" centered in the middle, close to the bottom. 

1. Use a dark gray background.
2. Insert five circular image frames in a visually appealing layout, each containing a relevant market image.
3. Ensure the images are evenly spaced and balanced around the title.
4. Adjust the size of the circles to create a cohesive look without overlapping the title.
5. Ensure the title text is in a clear, readable font and color that contrasts well with the background.
