1. **Background**: Use the provided image as the background. Add a dark overlay to ensure the text above it is clearly visible.
2. **Text Box**: Add a red cubic shape text box in the center.
3. **Text Content**: Inside the text box, include the question: "Which type of market is beneficial for the customers? Why?"
4. **Text Formatting**: Use a large, bold white font for the text to ensure readability against the red background.

Position the text box to ensure it stands out clearly against the background image.
