Create a slide with the following elements:

1. **Background**: Use an image showing a vibrant shopping scene at a multi-level eclectic urban store, as the slide background on the left side, in a half-circled shape.
2. **Title**: Add the text "ELO's" at the top of the right side of the slide in a prominent font.
3. **Subtitle**: Below the title, add "1. From production to consumption" in a slightly smaller font.
4. **Text Color**: Use a light color for the title and subtitle to ensure readability against the background.
5. **Overlay**: Add a semi-transparent dark overlay on the right side of the slide to enhance text visibility.
6. **Attribution**: Include the text "This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-SA." at the bottom in a smaller font size.

Ensure all elements are well-aligned and visually balanced.
