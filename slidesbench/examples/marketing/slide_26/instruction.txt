Create a slide with a dark gray background. 

1. Add three circular images: 
   - Place a circular image of fruits and vegetables in the top left.
   - Place a circular image of sugar in the bottom left.
   - Place a circular image of hanging clothes to the right.

2. Center the text on the right side: "From where you would like to buy the following products:" in a clear, readable font on the right side, ensuring it contrasts well with the background.

3. Adjust the layout for balance and clarity, ensuring all elements are visually appealing and easy to read.
