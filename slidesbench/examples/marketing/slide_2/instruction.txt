Create a slide with a blue background. Add the main question: "What is filling your bucket today and whatâ€™s draining it?" in a large, clear font on the top-left region.

On the right side, include an image of a bucket being filled with water from a yellow container. 

Label the top right with "Filling" and the bottom left with "Draining" using horizontal dotted lines to connect to the respective areas.

At the bottom, include the text bar "Students, draw anywhere on this slide!" in a smaller font using the image provided. 

Ensure the slide has a footer with "Pear Deck Interactive Slide" and a QR code, maintaining the provided design elements.
