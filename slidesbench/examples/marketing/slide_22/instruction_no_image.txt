Create a slide titled "After Sales Services" in a large, clear font on the right side, with white text color and black solid background. 

1. **Background**: Use a dark teal background.
2. **Images**: Place three images on the left side:
   - Top left: Image of a person holding a sign that says "KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER."
   - Top right: A word cloud related to customer service.
   - Bottom: An image of a cashier assisting a customer.
3. **Image Captions**: Add a small caption below each image stating "This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY-SA-NC" for the first two images and "This Photo by Unknown author is licensed under CC BY" for the last image.
4. **Text Formatting**: Ensure the title is in white font for contrast against the dark background. 

Align the images vertically and ensure they are evenly spaced.
