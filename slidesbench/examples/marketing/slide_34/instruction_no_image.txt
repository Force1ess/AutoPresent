Create a slide with the title "Let's Recall:". Below it, add the subtitle "Differentiate between Wholesaler and Retailers". 

1. Use a clean, modern font for both titles.
2. Center the text on the slide.
3. Set the background color to a gradient of dark green.
4. Ensure the title text is white and the subtitle text is bold for emphasis.
5. Optionally, add a small red rectangle in the top right corner for visual interest.
