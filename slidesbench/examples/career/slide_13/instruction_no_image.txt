Create a slide titled "IMPORTANCE OF SKILLS BEYOND ACADEMICS" in a large, bold font at the top.

Add the following sections as bullet points, using a smaller font size:

- **Health and Wellness**
  - Skills related to physical and mental health, such as stress management, nutrition, and self-care, contribute to overall well-being and a higher quality of life.

- **Digital Literacy**
  - With the digitalization of many aspects of life, digital literacy skills are essential for navigating technology, staying safe online, and using digital tools for various purposes.

- **Networking and Relationship Building**
  - Building a strong professional and social network is vital for career advancement and personal growth.
  - Effective networking skills can open doors to opportunities and resources.

- **Conflict Resolution**
  - Conflict is a natural part of life, and the ability to resolve conflicts constructively is valuable in both personal and professional relationships.

Use a dark background for the slide and ensure the text is in a contrasting light color for readability. Use warm yellow color to highlight sub-titles, use white/light gray for other texts.
