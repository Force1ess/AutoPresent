Create a slide titled "IMPORTANCE OF SKILLS BEYOND ACADEMICS" in a large, bold font at the top. Use a dark background for the slide.

Add the following bullet points, using a standard bullet format:

- **Financial Literacy**
  - Skills include budgeting, saving, investing, and making informed financial decisions.
  
- **Leadership and Teamwork**
  - Leadership skills involve motivating and guiding others toward common goals.
  - Teamwork skills enable collaboration and the ability to work effectively in diverse groups.
  
- **Time Management**
  - Effective time management and organizational skills improve productivity and reduce stress.
  
- **Creativity and Innovation**
  - These skills lead to the development of new ideas, products, and solutions.
  
- **Cultural Competence and Diversity**
  - In an increasingly globalized world, understanding and respecting cultural differences is essential.
  - Cultural competence promotes inclusivity and effective interactions in multicultural environments.

Highlight the subheadings (e.g., "Leadership and Teamwork") in a contrasting color (e.g., yellow) to make them stand out. Use white/light gray color for all other texts. Ensure the text is clear and legible against the dark background.
