Create a slide titled "ACADEMIC WORLD AND PROFESSIONAL WORLD" (white) with the subtitle "DEMANDS AND CHARACTERISTICS" in a bold, large font (yellow). 

In the main content area, include the following text:

1. "In summary,"
2. "• Academic world focuses on education, intellectual development, and theoretical knowledge."
   - "• Assessment primarily aimed at understanding and demonstrating knowledge."
3. "• The professional world, on the other hand, emphasizes the application of knowledge and skills to achieve specific goals."
   - "• Assessment based on job performance and outcomes."
4. "• While both worlds contribute to an individual's overall development, they have distinct demands and expectations."
5. "• Transitioning from the academic to the professional world often requires adapting to a different set of priorities and challenges."

Use a dark background for the slide. Ensure the main title is in a light color for contrast, and use a consistent font style throughout. Bullet points should be clearly marked, and the text should be easy to read.
