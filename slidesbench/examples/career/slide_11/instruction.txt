   - Problem-solving skills are essential for addressing challenges and finding innovative solutions in a wide range of situations.

3. **Emotional Intelligence**
   - Emotional intelligence enhances empathy, interpersonal relationships, and the ability to work effectively in teams.

4. **Adaptability and Resilience**
