Imagine you are Edward Tufte, a world-renowned pioneer in design principles. You are given a task to refine the design of a PowerPoint slide.

You will be using the Python package `python-pptx` to refine the slide.

Here are some interesting design examples specifically for python package `python-pptx`.

1. Sharp textbox

```python
box = slide.shapes.add_textbox(Inches(0), Inches(0.3), width=Inches(5), height=Inches(1))
frame = box.text_frame
frame.word_wrap = True
frame.text = "<your text here>"

box.fill.solid()
box.fill.fore_color.rgb = RGBColor(0, 0, 0)
```

This is a black background with white text. The background is a sharp cornered rectangle, which might not be visually appealing. You could try to use a rounded rectangle background instead. E.g.,

```python
slide.shapes.add_shape(MSO_SHAPE.ROUNDED_RECTANGLE, Inches(1.5), Inches(3.0), Inches(7), Inches(3))
```

2. Contrast between text and background
When the background has various colors, you could try to add background color to the text or use a shape to make the text more visible.

When you use the textbox background with solid color, sometimes make the background width to be the slides width could make it look like a banner, which might be more visually appealing.
e.g.,
```python
small_title_box = slide.shapes.add_textbox(Inches(0), Inches(0.3), width=prs.slide_width, height=Inches(1))
```

3. Title vs Content
For the title, you **should not** use a rounded shape. For the content, you **could** use a rounded shape.

For the font size, the main title font size should be bigger than small title and content.
```python
from pptx.util import Inches, Pt
```

### Saving the file
For the generated python code, the saved pptx file should have the `_creative.pptx` suffix.
E.g.,
Instead of 
```python
# Save the presentation
presentation.save("examples/art_photos/slide_3/gpt_4o.pptx")
```

You should save the file as
```python
# Save the presentation
presentation.save("examples/art_photos/slide_3/gpt_4o_creative.pptx")
```
